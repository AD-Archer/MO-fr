# Mohamed Souare - Developer Portfolio

## About Me

Hi, I'm Mohamed Souare. I am a graduate of Belmont Charter High School and currently attend LaunchPad Philly. Before joining LaunchPad, I felt uncertain about my futureâ€”while I excelled academically, I lacked direction. As graduation approached, I realized that pushing through school wasnâ€™t enough to prepare me for lifeâ€™s challenges. Thatâ€™s when I decided to join LaunchPad, and itâ€™s been a transformative experience. 

Now, Iâ€™m dedicated to mastering coding and computer programming, continuously learning from the people around me, my accomplishments, and the challenges I face.
